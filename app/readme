// TODO
// important
- pick LineGraphWidget colors based on BarGraphWidget::Mode

- test: extra thread for serial communication necessary?
- stop measurement based on gradient, ui symbols for status

- debug selection
- add absolute mode to lineGraph
    -> Delete x-label, Edit y-label
    -> add absolute values in kOhm
- clean up saving/ loading
    -> introduce a well defined save/load module ?
- set label size based on y-range
- set label color
- free zoom
- load data: don't replot before loading all data, rescale to full measurement size
- load/ save data: make timestamp string
- getSelection is buggy -> use different selection marker

// optional
- move multiMode to vector
- sync relative and absolute graphs
